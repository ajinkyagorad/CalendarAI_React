## Overview
This document outlines the current state of the AI Gemini Calendar application and the issues that need to be addressed in future development.

## Current Status
- Basic application structure is complete

### 3. Packaging and Distribution
- **Issue**: Challenges with creating a standalone executable
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Used electron-builder for packaging
  - Created batch files for easier launching
  - Modified build configuration in package.json
